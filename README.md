# Hi, My name is Jeetaditya Chatterjee (Jeet)

I write a lot of stuff as a way for me to learn. I put them up here to allow
people to check them out and say that I am cool or dumb or _"should be using
arch"_

Here is a bullet point list about me and my projects:

- I like learning about my tools and how they work, I am a proponent of emacs and
  linux mainly becuse of the tools available. [My dotfiles are probably a
  healthy (or unhealthy) example of
  that](https://github.com/jeetelongname/dotfiles)
- I am facinated by compilers and language design
  I don't know where it came from but I enjoy the entire process
- I advocate for open source.
  I try and remove as many pieces of proprietary software that I can and suggest
  good alternatives as well
- I cook! you can blame my dad for that
- If you want to get in touch make an issue on one of my repositorys or [check out my
  website](https://jeetelongname.github.io)

Now.. have some stats!
